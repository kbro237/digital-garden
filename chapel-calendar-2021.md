# Lessons

## Stories about Jesus

### This Little Light

No one puts a light under a bushel. What lights do the kids have to share? Sing the song, obviously.

### I Am the Good Shepherd

...

### Zacchaeus

Zacchaeus had no friends, partly because people can be mean and partly because Zacchaeus cheated others. But when Jesus invites himself to dinner Zacchaeus finds out that God is already his friend and it changes his life...

... and play the song.

### How to Pray

[@Lloyd-Jones2007 222]

### Fishers of Men

What is a fisher's very important job? *You* have a very important job which is telling others about and showing others God's love...

... and play the song.

### Washed with Tears

[@Lloyd-Jones2007 280]

### A New Way to See

[@Lloyd-Jones2007 334]

### The Friend of the Little Children

[@Lloyd-Jones2007 256]

### The Captain of the Storm

[@Lloyd-Jones2007 236]

### Treasure Hunt

[@Lloyd-Jones2007 250]

Except use the story of the Lost Coin instead.

### Jesus is Not the Little Red Hen

[@Augsburg1993 98] Tell the story of *The Little Red Hen.* Jesus said that he was Bread from Heaven...but bread that none of us can earn. He chooses to give us bread even though we did not work for it.

### Jesus the Mother Hen

Love and Sacrifice, see Luke 13:31--35.

### For God So Loved the World

...


### Who's the Greatest?

Disciples arguing about who is the greatest. Identify the way that the world defines greatness. Then how Jesus says to be great, you must serve.

### Jesus Saw the Blind Man

From the Gospel of John, ch. 9, when others saw a beggar and blind man, Jesus saw a person, a friend. Jesus spoke with him. (Have kids close their eyes.) Jesus put mud over his eyes, told him to wash and ... (Have kids open their eyes) he could see!

Whatever problem we may have, even if people make fun or ignore us, Jesus sees us and Jesus loves us.

### Daily Bread

Jesus taught us to pray for our daily bread, and who doesn't love bread? Actually, daily bread is everything that we need every day to be healthy and whole and God provides all of it from the air we breathe, to the food we eat, to the people that love us.

[@Augsburg1997 Series A]?

### Jesus walks with Us

In the Passion Narrative we encounter some scary stuff. People did really mean stuff to Jesus. Jesus makes us a promise that no matter what happens to us, and no matter what we see, he will always walk with us. You cannot scare God away!

### Jesus Lifted Me

Sometimes we fall down and skin our knees. It hurts. But it's OK, because Jesus helps us back up. Sometimes we're scared to try new things. But it's OK, because Jesus helps us back up. We're afraid we might make others mad at us. Jesus helps us back up. There's nowhere we can go where Jesus won't find us and pick us back up again. Sing: I'm So Glad Jesus Lifted Me

### Loving Others

Jesus said to love others, but that can be really hard -- especially when they seem unlovable. Love means acting like a true friend to others even when they don't deserve it. It's what God does for us!

### 1 Lost Sheep

Hide one cotton ball out of a big bag and look for it while telling the Parable of the Lost Sheep

## Stories from the Hebrew Scriptures

### In the beginning

[@Lloyd-Jones2007 18] Show some examples of plants, creepy things, etc. Let kids see themselves as creations.

### A New Beginning

[@Lloyd-Jones2007 38]

### Moving Like Ruth

Using a large cardboard box, tell the story of Ruth with an emphasis on the scariness and promise of moving. Naomi taught Ruth about a God that goes with us; Ruth went with Naomi in faith.

### Son of Laughter

[@Lloyd-Jones2007 56] Ham up the star-counting and the laughing. Emphasis: we are all one big family of God's.

### The Forgiving Prince

[@Lloyd-Jones2007 p. 76] The big moment here is the hug.

### Baby Moses

### God makes a way

[@Lloyd-Jones2007 92] Include some of the story of Pharaoh and changing his mind. Have the kids use their arms to act like a sea, have the left side move to their right and vice versa and tell the story while walking up the center aisle.

### Water from a rock

Tell the story of the grumbling thirsty Israelites using a staff for Moses and a covered up bowl of water hiding under a 'rock.' When it comes time for water from a rock, take out the bowl and use a pine bough or something to 'asperge' the kids with *surprising water.*

### Righteousness and Mercy

Use idea from p. 14 of [@Erlander1992] Teach about the balance between righteousness (doing the right thing) and mercy (forgiving and being forgiven when we don't do the right thing.) Use a yard stick to show what happens when you go too far to one side.

### Go, Abraham

Demonstrate using a map to go somewhere. God tells Abraham (Abram) to 'go to a place that I will show you.' That's it. No map. No directions. No phone. But what does Abraham have with him?

### The Lord Calls Samuel

We meet old Eli and young Samuel, the boy. Samuel had a special job: taking care of the place where people worshiped. Three times, while sleeping in the temple, Samuel hears, "Samuel, Samuel," so he goes to Eli, "Here I am, for you called me." Eli tells him to go back to sleep except for the last time when he tells Samuel to say, "Speak, Lord, your servant is listening." He does and God tells Samuel big important things. Now Samuel had a new job: tell all the people about what God was saying!

### The Teeny King

[@Lloyd-Jones2007 p. 116] Maybe use a stool to appear larger for the bigger brothers?

### Naaman learns to listen

Naaman was a big important man with a big problem: he had leprosy. Even though he was big and important, he knew he needed help. He was told that the God of Israel could do it. So Naaman went to the king, since he was big and important -- but kings don't heal! Then he went to Elisha, but was miffed when Elisha didn't even come out in person to tell him to go wash in the Jordan. But there Naaman was big and important! And knew about bigger and important rivers in his own country! He was convinced to do it and found healing. No matter how big and important you are, you always need God.

### Daniel in the Lion's Den

[@Lloyd-Jones2007 p. 152] Make sure the kids roar like lions and then try roaring with their mouths closed.

### Jonah

[@Lloyd-Jones2007 p. 160] Saying YES and NO to God. Use a sign with a big arrow to point the direction to (and away from) Nineveh.

### God's Peaceful World

[@Arthur2009 p. 172]

## Themes in the Year

### First Week

Introduce a few songs and give their explanations. Introduce Jesus as our friend and a guide who's going to walk with us and teach us.

### Thanksgiving

Have them shout "Thank You!" -- a **good** way to say thank you to God. Have them shout it louder -- a **great** way to say thank you. The **best** way? To share what we have with our neighbors.

## Fruits of the Spirit

### Love

Love is a fruit of the Spirit[^fruit] that is given to us. It first comes from God and grows in us so we can share it with others. Examples: your parents or teachers who would do anything to take care of you. Or, that feeling you get when you get happy because you share with someone and it makes them happy. 

### Joy

Make an angry face. Now, make a big smiling face. Feel the difference? Joy is a gift from God that frees us up to move and do what God wants for us.

### Peace

Peace like a river. Peace flows from God. It just keeps coming, even when things aren't going well, always reminding us that God will take care of us. Even when we aren't happy -- we can have peace.

### Patience

Isn't hard to wait. Birthdays are a good example. Practice waiting for a song. 

### Kindness

It's easy to be nice to someone when they are nice to you. But it's harder to be nice when you don't want to. That's kindness.

### Generosity (Goodness)

Talk about generosity while picking up coins. I like these coins and I want to keep them. If I think about sharing them, I could get scared. What if I run out? God is generous with us which means there will always be enough to share. I can share these coins!

### Faithfulness

Faithfulness is doing what we say. Keeping promises. Most importantly God keeps promises to us. God is faithful to us.

### Gentleness

I'm squishing your head exercise. Also, imagine holding a baby kitten. Sometimes it's hard to be gentle because we are prone to being too fast, too loud, or just too much. But God is the ultimate gentle giant and gives us the ability to be gentle, too.

### Self-Control

Breathing exercises to help us make good decisions when we are feeling angry.

## Advent / Christmas

### Waiting

It's hard to wait for Christmas, but in the meantime, God is already at work.

### God's Making a List

Santa has his naughty/nice list, and that's fine for Santa, but God has a different list. It's a list of every single person's name, and God knows and loves every single one of them. Have the kids yell their names!

### God Chose Shepherds

Shepherds were outcasts in Jesus' time. Smelly, worked at night, seemed suspicious even though they were just doing their job... Yet God chose shepherds to tell the Good News to.

### He's Here

[@Lloyd-Jones2007 176] It's the Christmas story, basically.

### The Magi

[@Lloyd-Jones2007 192] *The King of all kings.*
